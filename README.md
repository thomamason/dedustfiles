### thomamason's dotfiles ### v3 -- 20/02/2020

Welcome to my dotfiles repo. My main linux machine is an 1vyrained Thinkpad x230 w/ 7-row 'classic' keyboard, IPS screen (I'm going to upgrade to nitrocaster's FHD mod during the summer), and a second msata ssd for a win10 install (I've just got to have ableton. Can't live without it).

The 'V3' of this file is for the 3rd Arch install I've performed on this machine, each using these dotfiles in conjunction with a fork of Luke Smith's [LARBS](https://www.github.com/lukesmithxyz/LARBS) to bootstrap my system. 

As such, many of these files are [luke smith's](https://www.lukesmith.xyz) 'larbs' & 'voidrice' repo's ripped apart and hacked together again to better suit my needs.
