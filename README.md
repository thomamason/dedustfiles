### thomamason's dotfiles ### v3 -- 20/02/2020

Welcome to my dotfiles repo. My main linux machine is an 1vyrained Thinkpad x230 w/ 7-row 'classic' keyboard, IPS screen (I'm going to upgrade to nitrocaster's FHD mod during the summer), and a second msata ssd for a win10 install (I've just got to have ableton. Can't live without it).

The 'V3' of this file is for the 3rd Arch install I've performed on this machine, each using these dotfiles in conjunction with a fork of Luke Smith's [LARBS](https://www.github.com/lukesmithxyz/LARBS) to bootstrap my system. 

As such, many of these files are [luke smith's](https://www.lukesmith.xyz) 'larbs' & 'voidrice' repo's ripped apart and hacked together again to better suit my needs.

_The Catch_ : Between i3 and dmenu, Linux is the better way for me to work and I only wish I'd gotten here sooner. I'm trying to gear my system towards convinience and efficacy, but not at the expense of getting my daily grind done, so updates here are sparse. That said, here's a list of stuff I've got planned for the future...

**TO DO:**
	* Switch back to i3bar from polybar. Maybe.
	* Make script to toggle compositor transparency on/off.
	* Update scripts readme in .local/bin to explain new additions.
	* Automate syslinux "rice"
	* Tidy up my 'LARBS' fork.
	* Consider whether a seperate dotfiles directory with symlinks might be more efficient.
